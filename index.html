          <h2>About All-Told</h2>
          <p>
            All-Told started as a way to share homemade hot sauces with the people we care about.
            Instead of guarding the recipes, we decided to publish them openly so anyone can recreate
            the flavors in their own kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is simple: delicious, dependable sauces with ingredients you can recognize
            and a recipe that is always just one click away.
          </p>

        <h2>Our No-Secrets Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          There is a lot of food marketing built on mystery and vague labels. All-Told is the opposite.
          If you like one of our sauces, you should be able to learn exactly what is in it and how to
          make it yourself.
